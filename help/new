New to MUDs? never mind...

Smud is organised into areas, the area you have started in is the designed 
for new players, have a look around, the 'commands' command will tell you 
what you can do, help files are also available for most commands.

Have a look at 'help movement' to learn how to navigate the Smud world, 
most other things you will learn along the way with some patience and 
experimentation.

See `help newbie' for a quick reference of commands to get you started.
