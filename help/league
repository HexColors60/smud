League

There are several leagues that are used to measure success on SMUD:

league            - Players ranked by xp score
league kills      - Players ranked by total number of (non-trivial) kills
league areas      - Areas ranked by number of mobs killed 
league mobs       - Mobs ranked by number of times they have died

Without further argument, division 1 will be shown.  To view further
divisions add the required number after the command:
e.g. league 2
     league kills 3

Use this information in whatever manner you see fit ... ;)
