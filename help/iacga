Iacga and colour

If you use TinyFugue as a client for SMUD then you will not, by default, 
see a prompt at the bottom of the screen.  To enable a prompt please type
`iacga'.  You should then see a prompt immediately.  If for any reason 
you wish to toggle this then repeat the command.

Similarly, if your term supports colour then use the `colour' command to
enable colour if you did not do so on login.  This is also a toggle. Use
of colour greatly enhances the clarity of SMUD.
