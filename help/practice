Skills

Skills on SMUD are divided into levels.  Your Guild will determine to what
extent each skill can be practised. You must be in your guild practise room 
to practise skills in exchange for practise points.

Syntax: skills                  - lists the top level skills
        skills [skill category] - lists the sub skills for that category
	practise [skill]        - practise that skill

For example, to practise dodge in the defense section of combat type:
        practise com.def.dodge

An asterix (*) next to the skill indicates that the skill is an extra
command, other skills will be used automatically when appropriate or
provide bonuses for certain actions.
