Witchcraft

Seen by many sorcerers as a lesser magic, witchcraft has a different type
of power to those of mainstream magic.  Witches are in tune with the natural
world and can draw on its energy.  They are able to interact with weather
and can control their own bodies to boost their stamina, or cause plague or 
cure illness.  Do not underestimate their power.
