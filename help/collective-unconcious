Syntax: cast collective-unconcious

This spell links the minds and bodies of everyone in your group. Group members
can donate health, mana and movement to an ethereal group spirit. Any equipment
or gold gained as a result of killing mobs will automatically be taken by the
spirit. Donated statistics will reduce individual statistics by the same
amount, but the whole group has access to the spirit's statistics. Thus a
warroir taking all the hits will effectively have a total health equal to that
of the total donated plus whatever that warrior has not donated. A similar
effect will occur for mages with mana. Death will only occur for group members
when their individual health and the health of the spirit is reduced to zero.
Upon leaving the group a player will recieve back all statistics they have
donated, and their share of any equipment and gold collected. The spirit is
created as only visable to the group and will vanish when the group disbands.
