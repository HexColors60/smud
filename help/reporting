Reporting to the SMUD admin

SMUD is a dynamic game and various parts are constantly changing. The GODs
appreciate that they make the odd mistake and are happy to have this pointed
out to them.  There are three commands available:

     bug    :  if something is not working as you expect
     typo   : if you find a mispelling
     idea   : if you think something could be done better or a new idea

For each of these you must have your `email' set and type the command followed by as much information as possible about the situation.  For example:
   
     bug in the blacksmith's armoury in the newbie area the blacksmith
     appears twice.
     >Bug logged, thankyou!
