Death

You cannot be a winner all the time...

Occaisionally you may be beaten in combat and unable to flee in time.
When your hp drops to zero you are rendered unconcious and at the mercy
of your opponent, which usually means death.  Upon your head being 
severed from your body, or whatever the manner of your untimely passing,
do not fear... you will always be resurrected at your recall site.  
There is no limit to the number of times that you can die!

When you die you will lose some experience, and your statistics will have
reduced to their minimums.  Anything affecting you (e.g. spells) will also
be lost. And your pride will be a bit dented of course.
