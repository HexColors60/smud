Experience

Your level of experience is an indication of your progression within the game.
For every 1000 experience points you rise a level and will earn practise
 points, which can be exchanged for better _s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c_s or for _s_k_i_l_l_s.
               Experience points can be earned in several ways:
                                    * _C_o_m_b_a_t
                                    * _Q_u_e_s_t_s
                                    * _R_e_w_a_r_d_s

You can check your experience level using the `score' or `group' commands.
