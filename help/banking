Banking

No more do you need to hide you gold under the mattress!  ATMs (automatic
tellar machines) are scattered through SMUD.  All ATMs work via retina scan
and can thus only be used by you.  When you are in a room containing an ATM
you may use the banking commands: balance, deposit, withdraw.

The command `balance' will show you current bank balance, which is completely
different to your purse balance.  To make a deposit use: `deposit <amount>',
and similarly to withdraw use `withdraw <amount>'. 

Interest is paid on your banked balance per SMUD week and will be proportionate
to your active time over this period and the current interest rate.  You can 
see the amount of interest you have been paid using the `balance' command.

The `finance' command shows the current state of SMUD's fiscal system.
