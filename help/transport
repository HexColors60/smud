Transport

As well as travelling by foot, there are various antiquated transports
that will take you around SMUD.  Signs indicating stopping points for
buses, trains etc have been dotted around the world, so don't forget
to brush up on your reading skills...

Drivers will warn the room when the vehicle is about to depart. Use
`enter [vehicle]' to board.  Once on board, you may not fight or use
magic, and you cannot leave until the vehicle has arrived at its next
stop, at which point a new exit will appear and you will be informed of
arrival.  Use this exit in the normal way to depart.

Not all vehicles will force you to stay in your seat, especially for 
long journeys...
