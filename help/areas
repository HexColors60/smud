Areas

Typing `areas' will list all available areas.  The values before the area
name shows the current minimum and maximum `rating' values of the mobs in 
that area as a guide for how difficult the area is.  This is a dynamic value
so it may be an idea to check vefore travelling to an area...

There are two sorts of area - `real' locations that a UK road map will guide
you through, and `fantasy' areas that are reached through transportation.

Anyone can submit an area. The area writing guide is available on the SMUD
webpages at: www.amber.org.uk/~smud/development/areaguide.html or on request
from any immortal.
Areas should be submitted to: smud@amber.org.uk
