Read

Syntax:  read [item]
         recite [item] [player]

From time to time you may need to read signs, notices, books or scrolls as
you wander around SMUD.  Whether you can read an item depends on how well
you understand the language.  Most signs are written in the common tongue.
(see `skills other')

If you want to read an item out loud, then you can use `recite'.  Reciting 
is necessary for magical scrolls and will be heard by everyone in the room.
If you want to read something to a specific player (i.e. take them to one 
side and whisper to them) then use `recite [item] [player]'.  Without a
player's name recite will be to the room.
