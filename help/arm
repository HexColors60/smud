Arming bombs

Bombs need to be armed before they will detonate.  To arm a bomb you must have it in your inventory and se `arm [item]'.  The bomb will now be live and will start it's countdown the next time it touches the ground (dropped).

An armed dropped bomb will tick down until it explodes, there is no way of knowing how long this fuse will be, but don't be around when it explodes...
