Ranks...

As with most MUDs, we have characters who are labelled as Immortals, these players can monitor and affect the MUD and it's components in many ways, be this to remove a faulty area/mob/obj or to discipline an annoying player.

The Immortal ranks on Smud are as follows:

    Guide     - Helps out new players, can teleport to any room.
    Caretaker - Can create homerooms, reset areas/mobs/objects.
    Overseer  - Can change player attributes, load new area/obj/mob files,
                can remove/bar annoying players, can transport players.
    IMM       - Can promote players, shutdown Smud, and generally has
                access to the source code.

Players cannot fight/group/etc in their Immortal state, this is not so much to remove cheating but to help stop players accidentally using IMM commands out of habit.

Please do not ask to be an Immortal, when there is need, players who are most dedicated to Smud will be selected.
