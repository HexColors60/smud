There are seven circles of magic on SMUD, each with its own unique style:
     Simple        - The minor magics, most can master these.
     Witchcraft    - Manipulation of the natural world.
     Alchemy       - Alteration of objects.
     Psych         - Control of mind.
     Kinesis       - Movement of matter.
     Elementalism  - Interaction with raw elements.
     Necromancy    - Alteration of life force.

The Sorcerers Guild gives a general grounding in all these disciplines, 
while more specialise guilds will guide you to mastery!
