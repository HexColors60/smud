Resting

In SMUD, you may be in one of three states: awake, resting or asleep.

Awake, you can do pretty much anything but your hp, mana and mv will 
regain very slowly.

While resting, you may not move or initiate attacks, although you are 
alert and can see and hear everything in the room.

While asleep you will not be aware of anything happening in your current
location (although you will still be able to hear all worldwide public
communication), and you may be attacked.  You will regain hp, mana and mv
at its quickest rate while asleep.

Syntax:
Sleep, rest, stand, wake.
