Watch

For debugging or monitoring of harrassment, you may wish to observe what
a player sees.  This is done using:

watch [player]

A message is flashed on the player's screen so they are aware they are
being watched.  Everything they recieve will be echoed to your own screen
 so you do not need to be following them.  Indeed, it is better if you are
 in your home room so as not to be confused.  Only one IMM may watch a 
 specific player at one time, but as an IMM you may watch more than one player.

The watch command is a toggle, and can be stopped by retyping watch [player].

Watch should only be used with the full consent of the player being watched
unless in exceptional circumstances.  Either way, the watched player is
informed.
