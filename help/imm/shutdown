Reboot

There are several ways in which SMUD can be shutdown or rebooted.

`reboot' without argument will do a seamless soft reboot of the game.

`shutdown reboot' will do a hard reboot, losing current connections,
but will automatically bring the game back up within 60 seconds.

`shutdown die' will close down the game completely and will then have
to have a manual restart.

SMUD doesn't crash, ever... :)
