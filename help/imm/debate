Debates

Debates on SMUD are to gain players opinions on all things pertaining
to the game, and give you the chance to let your views be known. Only
IMMs can create debates, although feel free to suggest topic ideas.

debate list           - list current active debates
debate show [number]  - show more information about a debate
debate add [subject]  - add a new debate, drops you in the editor so
                        you can input the body of the debate (for show)
debate close [number] - close an existing debate

To vote use:
debate vote [number] [yes/no/abstain]

If you have no feelings either way on a debate please use `abstain'
rather than just ignoring the debate so the IMMs know when an item
has been seen by most of the players.

Players must be level 2 to vote.
