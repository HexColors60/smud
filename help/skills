Skills

Skills on SMUD are divided into levels.  Your Guild will determine to what
extent each skill can be practiced. You must be in your guild practice room 
to practise skills in exchange for practice points.

Syntax: skills                  - lists the top level skills
        skills [skill category] - lists the sub skills for that category
	practice [skill]        - practice that skill

For example, to practice dodge in the defense section of combat type:
        practice com.def.dodge

An asterix (*) next to the skill indicates that the skill is an extra
command, other skills will be used automatically when appropriate or
provide bonuses for certain actions.
