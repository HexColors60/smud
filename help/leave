Home

You may go to your homeroom from any location as long as you are not in 
combat by typing `home'.  While at home, time is effectively stopped -
you will not gain any health and affects will not decrease.  To return 
to the world, the `leave' command will return you to the location in 
which you were before you went home.

To visit another player's home, type `visit playername'.  You may only
visit if their room is visitable and you are not barred, or if they have 
set the invite flag for you.  The leave command stil applies if you are
visiting.
