Homerooms

All players on SMUD may have a homeroom.  This is your own private room.  
If you would like a homeroom then please ask an immortal to create one
for you.  There is no level restriction, but you should be a regular 
player.

You may choose who enters your homeroom or whether it is open to all.

See also: visitable, unvisitable, key, invite, home, leave.
