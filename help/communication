 Communication
 
 There are many different ways of communicating on SMUD depending on what you
                           want to say and to whom:
                    Chat    : for all players to hear
                    Tell    : for a specific player
                    Say     : for everyone in the same room
		    Question: to ask questions about the game
		    Answer  : to reply to game questions
		    Gsay    : to speak to your group
                    Pager   : to leave someone a short message

Each of these has its own help file.
