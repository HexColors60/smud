Rating

If your level is a measure of how experienced you are, then your rating
is indicative of how tough you are.  Your rating is a combination of
your ability in attack and defense and is dynamic: changing your armour, 
weapon and anyspells or affects will change your rating.

You can see your rating with the `score' command.

Mobs also have ratings, and these are also dynamic.  The `areas' command
shows the current minimum and maximum ratings for the mobs in that area.
