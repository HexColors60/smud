Guilds

The `guilds' command will list all the current guilds, the level at which 
you may join and any fee.  You may remain in the Adventurers guild for as 
long as you wish.  Joining a guild will affect the balance of skills that 
you may learn.  The highest ranking player in a guild is automatically the 
Guildmaster.

To join a guild you must be in the guild rooms, fulfill any requirements
of the guild and use the `join' command.
