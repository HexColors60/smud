Movement

You may move in 10 directions on SMUD:
n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, up and down.

Not all directions may be accessable from any one room, and some exits may only
be one way, so take care when mapping areas. You may also need encounter doors.  
Some locations may only be reached by transportation using objects...

See also: open, close, use.
