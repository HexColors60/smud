Statistics

The `score' command shows your current statistics:
Your attributes (see help attributes)

Your hit points (hp), mana and movement (mv).  Hp is a measure of how healthy you are, and will increase as your level increases - as you get tougher.  Mana is a measure of concentration, your mental ability and affects your ability to cast spells and perform complex actions.  Your movement score limits how many rooms you can visit before you are exhausted from walking.

Your experience points (xp) determine your level and are, unsuprisingly, a measure of how experienced you are.  You recieve the benefits of gaining a level every 1000xp gained.

Your rating is a combination of how tough and well equiped you are, and will change if you change your level, armour or what currently affects you. (See `help affects'and `help rating').

You are also given information about your race, guild membership, homeroom, your wimpy value and the amount of gold in your purse.
