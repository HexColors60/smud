Hero

At level 50 you will become a hero.  Although you will continue to gain
experience, levels and points to improve your skills, your level increases
will no longer contribute to combat - you will be effectively level 50 for
all fighting situations.  Heroes do not have a seperate league, but upon 
use of `finger' or `examine', hero status will be evident!

A word of warning, as a mighty hero, you will have mighty falls should you
be beaten in combat.  Above level 50, the xp losses are significantly higher 
for non heroes.  You have been warned...
