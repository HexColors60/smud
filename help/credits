SMUD is an entirely original code, initially designed to fit within 16K of source code. This original version was coded by Kenny with area and mob files by Yss. The newbie area is based on this original file. The rest of the game has been dramatically increased from these humble beginnings by Kenny and Yss in terms of locations, commands and interactivity. New ideas and areas are always welcome from players, see `help ideas' and `help areas' for how to do this.

Also many thanks the 'The Hive' (www.hivechat.net) for inspiration and help.

Thanks go also to everyone who helped test the game in its test stage: Kenny, Yss, Dodger, Flibs, Frog, Monkeyrump (Sub), Asaz, Nairn, and Dax.

We hope you enjoy the game!
