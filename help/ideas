Ideas

The easiest way to submit an idea is to use the `idea' command within the game,
just type ideas followed by a sentance describing your idea.
If your idea is more complex, then email smud@amber.org.uk with your idea.
Admin will contact you with any questions about your idea and will let you know
when it has been implemented. You need to have set your email address via the
_`_e_m_a_i_l_' command, to use this function.
