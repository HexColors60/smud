Give

You may wish to give some of your equipment or money to another character,
whether they are a secondary character or a friend or clan member.

Syntax:   give [item] to [player]
          give [amount] coins to [player]

In both of these commands you may omit the `to' for brevity.  

In order to `give' you must be carrying (not wearing or wielding) the
object or have at least [amount] of coins in your purse (rather than your
bank account.
