Shopping

Across SMUD there are various shopkeepers who will be able to sell you
items to aid you on your travels.  Shopkeepers are usually identified 
by their description or by the description of the room in which they are 
located.  To interact with shopkeepers:
     list         : lists all items for sale
     buy object   : purchase object for list price
     value object : get shopkeeper's valuation of object 
     sell object  : sell object from your inventory for valued price.

Different shopkeeper will trade in different types of goods - what is 
worthless to one may be priceless to another.  Costs of goods will vary
so do your shopping carefully.
