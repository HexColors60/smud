Pager

Every player on SMUD has a pager. This can be used for sending short messages,
even when that player is not online. Paging is most useful if the person you
wish to contact may miss a tell i.e. through fighting or being afk. Short
messages such as `want to group?', `email me' or `back in 20 mins' work well.
You will be informed when you log on if you have any new messages and if you
recieve a message whilst online your pager will beep at you.

Syntax:
page send [player] [message] - sends a message
page read - reads all your messages
page delete [message number] - permanently deletes that message from your pager
