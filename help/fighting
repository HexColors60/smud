Combat

Fighting mobiles that are a challenge to you will result in you being awarded experience points. The tougher the mobile compared to you, the more points will be awarded, but the exact value will vary depending on a whole host of conditions. See help on `consider', `kill', `flee' and `wimpy' for more details.
