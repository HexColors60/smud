Magic

Magic on SMUD is performed by way of reading scrolls.  Scrolls can be bought, 
found or gifted to you, but the extent of the spell will depend on how well you 
can read the language of the scroll and how competent you are in that field of 
magic.

There are a wide variety of unusual scrolls, but we have been true to their
meaning with the effects of the spell.  Scrolls do not last forever as magic 
does not like to stay bound in that way.

Any spells that have lasting effect will require concentration to maintain and
will drain your mana for every hour they are in effect. So think carefully before
you cast too many spells!
