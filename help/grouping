Grouping

It's a lot easier to pick a fight with your mates than alone...

If you form a group then you will move together, attack together and
share experience.  To form a group, get in the same room and decide on
a group leader.  All players should `follow' the designated leader.  It
is up to the leader to use the `group' command for each following player.

Once grouped, the group command on its own will list the xp, hp, mana and
mv for each member of the group.  Players may leave the group at any time
by ceasing to follow the leader.  All members of the group will follow
the leader's movement.

If one member of the group initiates combat or is attacked, then all of
the group will have a brief turn to respond and then will automatically
join combat.

There is no bonus for being a group leader so it may as well be the player
who knows their way!
