Simple Sorcery

Although labelled as simple, these are not trivial magics!  Simple spells
are those which are useful in everyday life: creating light, protection,
healing, repairs to equipment and levitation for example.

Simple magics are a good complement to mastery in another magic discipline
or for the all round adventurer.
