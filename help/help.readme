Configuration of help files
***************************

Help files are written in simple HTML to enable them to be accessed online
easily. Help files are stored by topic in the appropriate directory.  In
each directory (except the spells directory) there should be a help file
that has the same name as the directory, listing the files and giving them
a brief description so that players can quickly and easily find the help
they need.
