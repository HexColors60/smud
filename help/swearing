Swearing

On, SMUD we believe in freedom of speech and accept that players may 
sometimes use more colourful language than is tolerable to others.
Because of this, we have included a swearing filter.  This will remove
any words which we deem to be likely to cause  offense from any channels
that you view.  This is a toggleable setting, invoked using: `noswear'.

If you have `noswear' on and you are still recieving words that you 
find offensive, please let an Immortal know so we can add them to the list.
