Signs

Around SMUD there are various signs that provide all manner of 
information from opening times of shops to transport routes and
much much more.  Most signs are written in the common language,
but some rare ones will be in other languages (see `skills other').
You need to ensure that you have practised your reading skills
else the writing will make no sense to you.

To read a sign type `read sign'.
