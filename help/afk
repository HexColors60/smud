Afk

Syntax:
aaffkk [[ttiimmee]]

This command indicates on the who list that you are not present at the keyboard
or are distracted doing other things. The time parameter is optional and counts
down the time you are away so other players will know when you are likely to
return.

If you are idle for 10 minutes then you go AFK automatically to protect you from aggressive mobs until you type your next command.
