Replace

The replace command allows you to substitute one of your secondary
characters as your primary character and head of your family.

Use:

replace <primary character> <secondary character>

You will then be prompted for your family password.  Remember, once the
change has been made the demoted family head will earn tax if they do not
advance just the same as all the other secondary characters (see `help
tax').
