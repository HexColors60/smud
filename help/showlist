Showlist

The `showlist' command details all the players for whom you have special 
instructions.  All of these commands are invoked using:
               command playername

To remove an entry, repeat the command.  For example:
               
	       friend kenny
	       >You set the Friend flag for Kenny.
	       friend kenny
	       >You unset the Friend flag for Kenny.

The instructions are:
               noisy  : player may `tell' to you even when you are `quiet'
	       ignore : you ignore all output from this player
