Quests - not yet implemented

Experience points may be gained by questing. Each quest may only be completed
once per player. There are two types of quest: quest areas and world wide
quests.
Quest areas are those in which you may not return to the main game until the
quest is completed, although you will still gain xp from killing mobiles whilst
completeing the quest. The only way to leave the area is to die or complete the
quest.
World wide quests are those in which you will have to find a specific mobile or
object and return it to the correct location. While you are hunting, you may
play the game as normal.
