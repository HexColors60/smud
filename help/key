Allowing others to enter your homeroom

If you would like your homeroom to be acessable to other players when you
are not online then you need to give them a key:
        key playername

If your homeroom is unvisitable but you would like some players to visit you
then you must give them an invite:
        invite playername

You can see who has keys or invites using `showlist'.
