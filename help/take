Take

Syntax:
ttaakkee [[oobbjjeecctt]]
get [object]

Take or get allows you to pick up an object from the current room, provided that you
have enough space and weight allowance to carry that object.

If there are multiples of an object then take `[object].[number]' will select the correct one.
