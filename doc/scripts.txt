The Smud scripting lanuage.. ssl

This file has and is being written along side development, so it may be crap, deal with it ;)

Events..

playerent:		// player enters a room
playerleave:		// player is about to leave the room
pleayerpostleave:	// player has left room
playerlogon:		// player logs on
playerlogoff:		// player logs off
playersay:		// player 'says' to the room
playeremote:		// player 'emotes' to the room

mobleave:		// A mob is about to leave
mobpostleave:		// the mob has left

objuse:			// object is used
objdrop:		// object is dropped
objwield:		// object is wielded
objhold:		// object is held
objtaken:		// object taken

tick:			// each game tick
gamehour:		// each game hour (about 30 seconds)
minute:			// real minute
hour:			// real hour

Variables..

A few 'special' variables are set for you...

$me			// the object the script is attached to
$player			// The player associated with the event
$mob			// the mob associated with the event
$obj			// the object associated with the event
$glob			// global variables available to the mud

If any of these are not applicable they will be set to 'UNSET'

The scripting portion can be in any object/room/mob in the 'script' attribute.
All statements are semicolon seperated with the exception of event tags which all end in a colon. all other characters between the end of a statement and the beginning of a new one are ignored (carriage returns, spaces, etc).
